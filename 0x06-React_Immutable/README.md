# React Immutable Tasks

Greetings fellow code adventurer!

This is a collection of tasks that involve working with the Immutable.js library in a React environment. Immutable.js is a JavaScript library that provides immutable data structures, which are useful when building React applications. Immutable data structures allow developers to avoid mutations and make code more predictable and easier to reason about.

## Requirements

- Node.js version 12.x.x or higher
- npm version 6.x.x or higher
- An editor like Visual Studio Code, vim, or emacs

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command in the terminal:

```
npm install
```

This will install Immutable.js and any other dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run lint`

Runs the linter to check for any linting errors.

## Tasks

Are you tired of endlessly mutable data and unpredictable state changes? Well, fear not my friend, React Immutable to the rescue!

In this set of tasks, you'll be working with the Immutable.js library, which provides a variety of data structures that can't be changed once created. Talk about commitment! 

First up, you'll be creating a constant map with a list of names. And no, you can't use Google Maps for this. Then, you'll export another constant, map2, that modifies some of the names in map1.

Next, you'll use your Immutable.js skills to concatenate two arrays with the concatElements function. And for those of you who prefer objects, don't worry, there's a mergeElements function for you too!

But wait, there's more! With the mergeDeeplyElements function, you'll be able to combine two objects in a deeply meaningful way. Think of it as a lovechild between your objects.

Finally, the printBestStudents function will showcase your abilities to filter students with scores below 70 and capitalize their first names. No more lowercase losers in your console!

So put on your thinking cap and get ready to Immutable your React experience. It's time to make your code stable and reliable with Immutable.js!

## Conclusion

Working with Immutable.js can be a bit different than working with plain JavaScript objects and arrays, but it can provide many benefits when building React applications. By following these tasks and exploring the Immutable.js documentation, you can become more familiar with how to use Immutable.js effectively in your React projects.
